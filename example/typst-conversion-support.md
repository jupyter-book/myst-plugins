# Typst conversion support

Exporting your project to a pdf using Typst (either the [plain_typst_book template ](https://github.com/myst-templates/plain_typst_book) or the [lapreprint template](https://github.com/myst-templates/lapreprint-typst)), may come with some challenges as not all symbols are automatically recognized. This plugin aims to help with that by providing a set of mappings from common LaTeX commands to their Typst equivalents. This is an in between step as ultimately these mappings should be integrated into Myst itself, specifically in [this repo](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/tree/main/packages/myst-to-typst).
