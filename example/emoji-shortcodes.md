# Emoji shortcodes 

The following emoji is expressed in the raw markdown as `:smile:`:

:smile:

And so on:

* `:+1::-1:` -> :+1::-1:
* `:grin:` -> :grin:
* `:fr:` -> :fr:

Emoji shortcodes can be used in many contexts, including:


## Quote blocks

```{myst:demo}
> :mag: in a quote block!
```


## Directives

```{myst:demo}
:::{card}

:mag: in a card!
:::
```

```{myst:demo}
:::{hint}

:mag: in a callout!
:::
```

## Roles

```{myst:demo}
{button}`:magic_wand: Button! <index.md>`
```
